# Animal Fun Facts

In this project, we’ll build a program that allows users to click an animal on the screen in order to have a fun fact pop up by using **React**.

The program will display a selection of animals on the screen. 

Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. 

The selected fact will pop up on the screen. As we keep clicking, we’ll be able to see different facts.
